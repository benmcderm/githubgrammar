## Features & Implementation

Built using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, & CSS.

The main hurdle that I overcame in this project was authenticating with the GitHub API.  With different pieces coming from the Chrome's library, GitHub's API requirements, and jQuery AJAX calls, it was a maze to navigate.  Once everything came together, I was quite happy with the result and have a solid grasp on Oath2 and token authentication.
